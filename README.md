Kaggle Competitions Portfolio
This repository contains my implementations for several Kaggle machine learning competitions.
Each folder is organized by competition and includes:
•	Jupyter notebooks used for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation
•	README files describing the competition, approach, evaluation metrics, and future improvements
•	Submission files (where applicable)
This repository will continue to grow as I complete additional Kaggle competitions.
